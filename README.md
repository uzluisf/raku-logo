# Raku Logo

## The concepts

With this version of the logo, I tried to capture the *essence* of two 
Japanese concepts and how they relate to the programming language
we've known as Perl 6.

- [Raku pottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raku_ware) is a type of Japanese
  pottery traditionally used in Japanese tea ceremonies. Raku is characterized
  by unpredictable results caused by simply altering certain variables (e.g., 
  glazes, temperature, and timing, etc.), intense colors and oftentimes quite
  unique patterns.

- [Kintsugi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi) is the art of repairing
  broken pottery by mending the areas of breakage with lacquer. As a philosophy,
  it treats breakage and repair as something prideful and part of the history
  of an object, rather than something to disguise.

## How they relate to Perl 6

As Larry Wall stated, Perl 6 was to be "the community's rewrite of Perl" which 
involved keeping and refining the good things that make Perl (or Perl 5) what
it's today, discarding those things that didn't work as envisioned and 
including the best (or most aptly) parts from research developments in 
Computer Science in the last century. Similar to handcrafting raku, this is a
constant effort to take programming language features and unify them as a
single unit. Certainly some of these features might not be intrinsically
related so it takes a delicate balance to mend them into a useful and better
whole.

According to the Perl philosophy, *there's more than one way to do it* because,
as [Wall states](http://www.wall.org/~larry/natural), "people not only learn as
they go, but come from different backgrounds, and will learn a different subset
of the language first" which is something Perl 6 pridefully embraces and thus
providing unique programming patterns to programmers is something Perl 6 does
best. After all, Perl 6 is designed so that you can "*learn as you go*", 
with the implicit expectation that everyone is learning at every stage of
the journey. *And that's okay*.

## The logo

By default, the logo is a simple and transparent vase (Raku) with golden
joints (Kintsugi). Ideally, the joints would remain golden (or some 
silvery-platinum color). However, the colors of the vase and the joints 
can be played with and thus obtain a color combination that fits the occasion.
