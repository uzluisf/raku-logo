# Raku Logo

## Version 1

### The concepts

With this version of the logo, I tried to capture the *essence* of two 
Japanese concepts and how they relate to the programming language
we've known as Perl 6.

- [Raku pottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raku_ware) is a type of Japanese
  pottery traditionally used in Japanese tea ceremonies. Raku is characterized
  by unpredictable results caused by simply altering certain variables (e.g., 
  glazes, temperature, and timing, etc.), intense colors and oftentimes quite
  unique patterns.

- [Kintsugi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi) is the art of repairing
  broken pottery by mending the areas of breakage with lacquer. As a philosophy,
  it treats breakage and repair as something prideful and part of the history
  of an object, rather than something to disguise.


### The logo

The logo is a simple and transparent vase (Raku) with golden joints (Kintsugi).
Its transparency allows for different color combinations. Ideally, the joints
would remain golden (or some silvery-platinum color) but it can be changed
to fit the occasion.

Right below there's a picture with the logo (alongside the name Raku)
with transparency and some color with transparent and white backgrounds.
If someone would like to play with different color combinations,
I've also provided the SVG files.
